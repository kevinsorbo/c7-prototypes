<h2 id="AbMe" class="heading"> About Me </h2>
<p >My name is Korey Lo.  I am currently 24 years of age. I was born and raised in Merced, CA. <br> I'm sort of a sports fanatic.  I love basketball and football. <br> My favorite sports teams are the San Francisco 49ers and the LA Lakers.

<h3 class="heading skills">JavaScript</h3>
<p>I want to be able to create cool interactive websites.</p>

<h3 class="heading skills">PHP</h3>
<p>I am curious to know how the server side of web development works.</p>

<h3 class="heading skills">GitHub</h3>
<p>Most if not all developers are proficient with GitHub and I want to be proficient with it as well.</p>

<h2 id="exp_header">Experience</h2>
<p id="exp_description">In my past job I was a substitute teacher for the Merced High School District.  I would introduce to the students their assignment for the day and help them if needed. <br> At times it felt as if I was just babysitting students and making sure they didn't burn the classroom to the ground.</p>
