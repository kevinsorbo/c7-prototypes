                    <p style="line-height: 300%">My name is Korey Lo.  I am currently 24 years of age. I was born and raised in Merced, CA. <br> I'm sort of a sports fanatic.  I love basketball and football. <br> My favorite sports teams are the San Francisco 49ers and the LA Lakers.

                    <p style="background-color:lightgrey; border-style:dotted; border-width: 0px 5px 5px 5px;">In my past job I was a substitute teacher for the Merced High School District.  I would introduce to the students their assignment for the day and help them if needed. <br> At times it felt as if I was just babysitting students and making sure they didn't burn the classroom to the ground.</p>
