                    <p style="background-color: lightgrey">In my past job I was a substitute teacher for the Merced High School District.  I would introduce to the students their assignment for the day and help them if needed.  At times it felt as if I was just babysitting students and making sure they didn't burn the classroom to the ground.</p>
